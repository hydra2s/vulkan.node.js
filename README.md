### 🐞 [Баг-Репорты/Bug-Tracker](https://github.com/hydra2s-info/about/issues) 🐞

Our Node.JS bindings for Vulkan API support (latest version, as possible). Currently, still in development. 

## Made for...

- Geeks
- Hackers
- Programmers
- Coders
- Professionals
- NOT newbies (JS and Vulkan)
- NOT weak persons

## Features

- Using raw pointers and typed structures
- Low abstraction levels (and there is no Vulkan-HPP)
- Pre-computing of enums and struct classes
- JS generator from Vulkan XML, with C++ supplements
- Some handmade fixes (such as bitfield structures)
- Planned support for glMatrix fully
- Planned support for WebAssembly bindings and memory
- Error and exception handling support
- Some syntax sugar for user-friendly
- Better error handling (with additional info)
- I made first hello triangle example

## TODO

- [ ] More type casting
- [ ] Support `set` operation for everything
- [ ] WebAssembly and AssemblyScript support
- [ ] Fix common bugs and issues
- [ ] Support for `{$: 0n}` handles (alike NVK)
- [ ] Add native pointers, BigInt and typed arrays for GLFW
- [ ] Better indexed operations (such address, etc.)

## Test code

We made first example: https://github.com/hydra2s/vulkan.node.js/blob/main/test.js
